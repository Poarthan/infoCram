# infoCram
An open source customizable tool for studying aid.

## Basic Setup
This is developed primarily for a debian-flavored linux system, so the README instructions will mirror that, but the match game is runnable on other systems.
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Match
The matching game is still in the works, has some obvious flaws with longer words, no timer and no way to replay and no leaderboard.

To run just do:
```
python3 match.py
```

## Learn
More important is learn, which is a good way to quickly memorise a bunch of things.

To run just do:
```
python3 learn.py
```
